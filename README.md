Infrastructure as Code for Single Page Application (SPA) Deployment on AWS
This repository contains Terraform scripts to provision the necessary infrastructure on AWS for deploying a Single Page Application (SPA). The infrastructure includes an S3 bucket for hosting static web content, a CloudFront distribution for content delivery, an API Gateway for backend services, and a Lambda function for serverless compute.

Usage
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:

Terraform CLI
AWS CLI
AWS IAM credentials with appropriate permissions
Deployment Steps
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Initialize Terraform:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
Review and customize the variables.tf file as needed to match your desired configuration.

Deploy the infrastructure:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
After deployment is complete, the outputs will provide the necessary information such as the S3 bucket URL, CloudFront distribution URL, API Gateway endpoint, etc.



###Security Recommendations
For each service, consider the following security recommendations:

#S3 Bucket:

-Enable server-side encryption (SSE) to encrypt data at rest.
-Implement bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to the bucket.
-Enable versioning to retain multiple versions of objects for data protection.

#CloudFront:

-Configure security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, Strict-Transport-Security) to mitigate common web vulnerabilities.
-Use signed URLs or signed cookies for restricting access to content and preventing unauthorized downloads.
-Utilize AWS WAF to protect against common web exploits such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and known malicious bots.

#API Gateway:

-Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms such as API keys, IAM roles, or OAuth tokens.
-Use HTTPS for secure communication between clients and the API Gateway.
-Enable request throttling and IP whitelisting to protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
-Integrate AWS WAF with API Gateway to filter and monitor HTTP/HTTPS requests, blocking malicious traffic before it reaches your API endpoints.

#Lambda Function:

-Follow least privilege principle when assigning IAM roles to Lambda functions, granting only the necessary permissions.
-Enable AWS CloudTrail to log Lambda API calls for auditing and compliance purposes.
-Implement code signing to ensure the integrity and authenticity of Lambda deployment packages.
-Utilize AWS WAF to create rules that inspect the content of requests and responses to Lambda functions, protecting against known attack patterns and common vulnerabilities.

##Logging and Monitoring

For logging and monitoring:

#CloudWatch Logs:

-Configure Lambda function logging to capture logs and monitor function execution.
-Create CloudWatch Alarms to trigger notifications for specific Lambda function metrics (e.g., errors, duration).
-CloudTrail:Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API activity across your AWS infrastructure, including API Gateway and Lambda function invocations.

#Amazon CloudWatch Metrics:

-Monitor CloudFront distribution metrics such as requests, data transfer, and HTTP status codes to detect anomalies and performance issues.

#AWS X-Ray:

-Use AWS X-Ray to trace and analyze requests as they travel through the API Gateway and Lambda function, identifying bottlenecks and optimizing performance.
